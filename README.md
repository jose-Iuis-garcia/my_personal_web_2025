# Personal Website – Practical Work II

## Description of the work
This project consists of the development of a personal website as a functional software deliverable.
The objective of the project is to demonstrate the correct use of semantic HTML, basic CSS styling,
and a clear modular structure following software development principles rather than focusing on
visual design.

The website includes several interconnected pages (Home, About, Contact, Net, Degree, Topic),
allowing navigation between them. The project also includes a specific subject page for
*Fundamentals of Computer Engineering*, which is linked from the degree overview page, as required.

All files are organized under the `docs/` directory to ensure clarity and compatibility with
GitHub Pages.

## Problems during the development
During the development of this project, several minor issues were encountered:

- Initial confusion regarding repository structure and file organization.
- Managing relative paths between HTML files located in different folders.
- Ensuring that images and CSS files were correctly linked from all pages.
- Understanding how to create progressive commits and pushes to reflect incremental development.

These issues were resolved by reorganizing the folder structure, carefully checking file paths,
and following a step-by-step approach to development and version control.

## Conclusions
This project helped reinforce key concepts related to software development, such as modular design,
clear structure, and maintainability. The use of semantic HTML and external CSS allowed for a clean
separation of concerns.

Additionally, the use of Git and GitHub encouraged incremental development and proper version
control practices. Overall, this project provided a solid introduction to structured web-based
software development and practical workflow organization.

## Additional notes
- The contact form does not store or process data, as no backend scripting is used.
- The project prioritizes functionality and clarity over advanced visual design.
